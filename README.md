# Doom Scroll Shield
A Chrome extension designed to help you break the cycle of doom scrolling and prevent overstimulation from social media platforms by blocking short videos.

# Description
In today's society, we're constantly surrounded by stimuli that can activate our brain's reward system, releasing dopamine and making us feel good in the short term. However, this constant overstimulation can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, and burnout. The problem is, many of us have unconsciously become addicted to the feeling of instant gratification provided by social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.

# The Dopamine Detox
Doom Scroll Shield is designed to help you detox your dopamine system and break free from the cycle of overstimulation. By blocking access to these platforms, you'll be forced to take a step back and reevaluate your relationship with technology. This can lead to a number of benefits, including:
